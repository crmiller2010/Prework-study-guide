# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## the study guide I was guided to make for the upcoming bootcamp I will be participating in.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide: I made this Prework study guide to gain experiences and be exposed to the languages I will be using in the upcoming bootcamp. I made this Prework study guyid with the help of the pre-work modules made availabel to me. 

- my motivation for doing this was to get a taste of what I will be in for, for the next 6 months
- I built this project to help serve as a refference for when I get stuck during the bootcamp. 
- the problem I solved was having no coding experience before this. 
- I learned that I have a lot more to learn.
